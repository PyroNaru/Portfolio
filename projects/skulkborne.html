            This is a modification inspired by the works of Lovecraft and games such as Bloodborne and Darkwood and seeks to 
            bring this madness and horror into Minecraft.

            Inspired by the likes of Miskatonic Mysteries and Bewitchment, Skulkborne aims to bring custom weapons, magical rituals, and
            fearsome enemies into the world of Minecraft. <br><br>
